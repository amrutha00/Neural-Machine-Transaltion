# Neural Machine Translation : Spanish-To-English


1. Developed a unidirectional single layer GRU encoder-decoder with attention mechanism and employed an autoregressive inference (decoding) function to translate Spanish to English
2. Trained an Encoder-Decoder Transformer model with positional embeddings and word embeddings for translation
3. Achieved a BLEU score of 0.0570 with a uniform distribution of 4 gram precision with an RNN and 0.0596 with a transformer
